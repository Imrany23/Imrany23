# Welcome to my GitHub Repository

** 👋 Hi, I’m @Imrany23, my name is Imran and I am from England.**

** 👀 I’m interested in Datm Engineering and analysis of the Data through Python and Azure**

** 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure and Python (I did a Python course but was not able to use it at work)**

** 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with anyone who wants to learn and enhance Python skills**

** 📫 How to reach me? you can always email me at imrany23@blueyonder.co.uk **

## My summary
An experienced Microsoft Azure Certified Data Engineering Product Owner/Software Engineer with a strong work ethic, who communicates and presents complex information, by creating ETL pipeline solutions directly using IBM and Microsoft Azure ETL tools and understands the needs of stakeholders. At National Gas I have experience of successfully leading the project Data Engineering team in the migration to Microsoft Azure from IBM InfoSphere where I managed a team of 15 members including Azure Synapse, Infrastructure and Striim experts. I have received recognition awards for my work from National Gas/Grid, BNP Paribas, Skills Funding Agency and the Valuation Office Agency from management and colleagues. I am currently enhancing my Python programming skills by taking a Bootcamp course in Software Engineering with HyperionDev and learning Databricks.

I will hopefully showcase my work here with a variety of projects from my work.

## Interests
I am always interested in anything with Data. I love to read and am a big football fan and supported Everton which has been pretty depressing as of late. I also love cricket with my Pakistani heritage.
